ftp (file transfer protol),early way for transferring files over the Internet Users used FTP programs to connect to servers; look at listings of available documents; and download documents of interest
World wide web (the web),Convenient way for computers to communicate files over the internet; created by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s; contained three things: 1. text files (HTML) containing links to other text files 2. A program known as a browser for viewing HTML files 3. A set of rules known as the HTTP protocol for transferring HTML files among computers
web page,a document that is viewed in a web browser
website,collection of related web pages
web server,program that serves web pages to web browsers
HyperText markup language (HTML),standard markup language for web documents
HyperText,text that has links to other texts (and today to images videos and more)
markup,in HTML; special markings in the document that provide additional information to links formatting and images

How many websites existed in 2011?,350 million
In what year did the number of Internet users surpass 3 billion?, 2015
web browser,program that downloads an HTML document from a web server;displays the document to the user with the appropriate formatting and allows the user to interact with the document
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), international standards organization that traditionally has controlled a number of web standards including HTML; HTML5 was the latest HTML standard released by the W3C in 2014
WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Grou),In 2019 W3C relinquished HTML standards to WHATWG; an organization that develops a variety web standards and whose members include the major browser vendors; produces the HTML Living Standard- continually evolving standard without versio numbers that replaces HTML5
The year the idea for generating links from within one document to other documents,1945
The year the term HyperText invented,1965
The year the first web browser is created,1990
The year the World Wide WEb Consortium (W3C) creatd,1994
The year HTML 2.0 standard published,1995
The year HTML5 standard published,2014
The year WHATWG controls the HTML standard,2019
A modern web page is composed of HTML CSS and JavaScript. What are each of their purposes?,HTML defines the structure and content of a web page; CSS specifies the layout and visible appearance; JavaScript describes the dynamic behaviors and actions of a web page
packet,contains To and From IP addresses- the information to communicate and other configuration information
ip-address (internet protocol address), a computer's unique address on the internet (like a house's unique address in the world); usually represented numerically like 198.51.100.7. A typical IP address is 32 bits-divided into 8-bit groups- each group often written as a decimal number
IPv4 and IPv6,IPv4 is original Internet protocol- has 32 bit addresses (4 billion unique addresses)--newer version IPv6 uses 128 bit addresses-capable of 3.4 * 10^38 addresses. IPv4 and IPv6 currently co-exist and likely will for a long time
domain name,name for an IP address such as the name wikipedia.org for the ip address 198.35.26.96; the name is easier to remember and type; capitalization of the domain name does not matter
DNS Server (Domain Name System),When a computer sends a packet using a domain name over the Internet the first step is to contact a DNS server to conver the domain name to an IP address; the thirteen main DNS servers are called root servers
top-level domains (TLD), .com ; .net ; .org ; .edu ; .gov ; each country is assigned with unique two-letter country code top-level domain (ccTLD) like .uk (United Kingdom) or .ru (Russia); ICANN-the organization that manages TLDs now allows companies and organizations to create customized TLDs like .church ; .pizza ; and .music
second-level domain, such as wikipedia in wikipedia.org - a second-level domain is commonly an organization's name as in Stanford.edu (the second-level domain name is Stanford);
third-level domain,third-level and further level domains reer to sub-computer systems local to an orgnaization (cs.stanford.edu ; the Computer Science department at Stanford); A common third-or-deeper-level domain is www- short for World Wide Web- usually referring to an organization's web server
URL (Uniform Resource Locator),the location of a web resource on the web such as http://cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm
web resource,any retrrievable item- like an HTML file- image; video; CSS style sheet; etc.
a URL is composed of these parts,scheme; hostname; and path
scheme,characters at the beginning of a URL followed by a colon ":" or a colon and double slashes "://". Common URL schemes include http ; https ; mailto ; and file
hostname,The complete domain name following the scheme in a URL. Ex: In http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol - the hostname is "www.cdc.gov"
path,all characters to the right of the hostname in a URL - Ex: in http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol - the path is "/alcohol
web page errors,1. if the domain name is not found by a DNS server a page is displayed indicated such as "Sorry, the website www.zzaya.blah cannot be found" 2. A domain name may exist but the web server may not respond. A message like "The website is not responding or "could not reach the website" - non-response could be due to web server being runed off or undergoing maintenance 3. If a web server is reached but the speific requested page isn't found the server returns a 404 status code (Page not Found)
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), a protocol suite that governs how data packets are transferred over the internet from one machine to another.
HTTP versions,HTTP/1.1 : standard used for most of the web's lifetime. HTTP/2 : many websites are adopting new HTTP standards that speeds up the transfer of information between web browsers and web servers. HTTP/3: in development - improves the speed of HTTP/2 by using UDP to transport data packets instead of TCP
DNS lookup, sending the domain name to the local DNS and getting back the IP address of the web-server hosting the domain name
HTTP request, a message sent from the web browser to the web server. Often the request asks the web server to send back a web resource like an HTML file; image; CSS style shee; JavaScript file; or video
HTTP response, a message sent from the web server back to the web browser in response to an HTTP request. Often the response contains the requested web resource.
An HTTP request and an HTTP response are both composed of four parts,1. Status line- the status line specifies the HTTP version being used. A request status line includes a request type and path; a response status line includes a status code. 2. Zero or more header fields- A header field is a keyword followed by a colon and a value. Header fields supply additional information about the request or response. 3. Empty line. 4. Optional message body- A message body contains data being transferred between a web browser and web server. In a request the message body may be empty or contain submitted form data. In a response the message body may contain the requested resource.
