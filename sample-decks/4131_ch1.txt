IPv4 and IPv6,IPv4 is original Internet protocol- has 32 bit addresses (4 billion unique addresses)--newer version IPv6 uses 128 bit addresses-capable of 3.4 * 10^38 addresses. IPv4 and IPv6 currently co-exist and likely will for a long time

second-level domain, such as wikipedia in wikipedia.org - a second-level domain is commonly an organization's name as in Stanford.edu (the second-level domain name is Stanford);
third-level domain,third-level and further level domains reer to sub-computer systems local to an orgnaization (cs.stanford.edu ; the Computer Science department at Stanford); A common third-or-deeper-level domain is www- short for World Wide Web- usually referring to an organization's web server
