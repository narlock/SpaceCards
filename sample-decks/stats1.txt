statistics,the science of conducting studies to collect, organize, summarize, analyze, and draw conclusions from data
scientific data,Facts obtained by making observations and measurements. Compare scientific hypothesis, scientific law, scientific methods, scientific model, scientific theory.
inferential statistics,consists of generalizing from samples to populations, performing hypothesis testing, determining relationships among variables, and making predictions
uncertianty,the experimenter's best estimate of how far an experimental quantity might be from the true value
variation,a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data setvariance is depicted by the o^2
population,consists of all subjects that are being studied
sample,a subset of subjects selected from the population
observation,Information obtained through the senses; fact or figure we collect about a given variable
factor,variables that experimenters control during an experiment in order to determine their effect on the response variable
experimental design,A design in which researchers manipulate an independent variable and measure a dependent variable to determine a cause-and-effect relationship
observational study,observes individuals and measures variables of interest but does not attempt to influence the responses
factor levels,the values of the factor used in the experiment
descriptive statistics,consists of the collection, organization, summarization, and the presentation of data
statistical inference,The process of using data obtained from a sample to make estimates or test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population.
mean,the arithmetic average of a distribution, obtained by adding the scores and then dividing by the number of scoresdenoted as x with a line above it
median,the middle score in a distribution; half the scores are above it and half are below itdenoted as median(population)
standard deviation,measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of valuesdenoted as greek o
p-value,The probability level which forms basis for deciding if results are statistically significant (not due to chance).
random sampling,selected by chance methods
biased sample,A sample that does not fairly represent the population
experimental unit,An individual in a study for which or for whom data values are recorded. Human experimental units are usually called subjects or participants.
completely randomized design,the treatments are assigned to all the experimental units completely by chance
sample range,max-min
sample standard deviation,Denoted by s, is the positive square root of s^2 (the sample variance)s = sqrt(s^2)
sample variance,denoted by s^2, given bys^2 = sum of (x-mean)^2/ (n-1)
degrees-of-freedom,The quantity n-1Could possible depict the number of independent pieces of information for computing variability
discrete data,counted data; cannot be divided and is distinct; can be graphed on a bar graph# of dogs# of studentsamount of money
continuous data,measured data; can be divided infinitely; can be graphed on a histogram or a line graphweight of the dogheight of the studentsthe time it takes to run a mile
qualitative variables,variables that can be placed into distinct categories according to some characteristic or attribute
quantitative variables,numerical in nature and can be ranked or ordered
parameter,variable which is drawn from a population
statistic,a variable which is a sample
Karl Pearson and R.A. Fisher,Two famous modern-day statisticans
Frequency table,a table which partitions data into classes (groups). It's a count data instrument
Relative Frequency Table,It is a table which states the proportion of values in a class relative to the total number of data values
Histogram,provides a visual display of organized data which are constructed in frequency/relative frequency tables
Bar Graphs,these graphs in most cases display qualitative data
Pie Graphs (charts),constructed with sectors of a circle. It is displayed visually by proportional parts of the total population that have a common trait
Stem-and-Leaf plot,a plot used in exploratory data analysis to rank and order and arrange data into groups
