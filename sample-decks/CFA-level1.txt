Doug Watson, CFA, serves in a sales position at Sommerset Brokerage, a registered investment adviser. Watson frequently drinks excessively. On one occasion, Watson was cited by local police for misdemeanor public intoxication. According to the Standard on knowledge of the law and the Standard on misconduct, Watson is in violation of:,,neither of these Standards.
